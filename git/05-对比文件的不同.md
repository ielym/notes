# 1 对比工作区和某个版本的文件

编辑`code.txt`，添加：`this is the fifth line`

```
this is the first line
this is the second line
this is the third line
this is the forth line
this is the fifth line
```

现在想要对比**当前工作区**和**HEAD**指向的版本的不同：

```
git diff HEAD -- code.txt
```

```
index 908c5b7..4b06a0f 100644
--- a/code.txt
+++ b/code.txt
@@ -1,4 +1,5 @@
 this is the first line
 this is the second line
 this is the third line
-this is the forth line
\ No newline at end of file
+this is the forth line
+this is the fifth line
\ No newline at end of file
```

上面的输出中，`---`代表`HEAD`指向的`code.txt`，`+++`代表工作区的`code.txt`

# 2 对比两个版本的文件

想要对比`HEAD`和`HEAD`的前一个版本中的`code.txt`文件

```
git diff HEAD HEAD~1 -- code.txt
```
